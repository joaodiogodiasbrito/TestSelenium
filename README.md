# TestSelenium

Hi,

This build was created as a Final Project of the Udemy course:
Selenium Webdriver with Java (Basics + Advance + Architecture), Teacher Raman Arora

I have made a few changes and created my own tests which can be translated into:

TestA2 - Test All links in Wikipedia website

Chrome Browser
TestB1 - Test Gmail account (already created), send email and password and enter in the gmail account;
TestB2 - Test All links in Wikipedia website

This build can be run from 3 different levels:
-Test Case Level
-Suite Case Level
-All suites Level

This build is a Maven Project compiled on InteliJ, the dependencies are included in the POM.xml,
and also includes functionalities such as:
- Excel Reader
- TestNG reporting, including TestNG Annotations and Data Providers
